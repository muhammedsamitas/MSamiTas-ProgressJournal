### Forecasting Solar Power Production
#### The target was forecasting hourly solar power production, using different weather variables and grid points. Linear regression based on time series decomposition and ARIMA models were implemented. You can find details in [here](/files/Forecasting_Solar_Power_Production). You can also access R codes from [here](/files/R_codes_for_Forecasting_Solar_Power_Production.R)


### Does prior knowledge have an impact on peopleâ€™s decision-making in the gain and loss domains?
#### We observed how people behave according to different risk options in gain domain and loss domain. We then tried to manipulate their decisions in the face of risk by informing them about the expected value. T-test and Wilcoxon test were implemented.
